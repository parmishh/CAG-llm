# Advantages of CAG

- Reduced Latency – Eliminates real-time retrieval, enabling faster inference.
- Improved Reliability – Minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance.
- Simplified Design – Provides a streamlined, retrieval-free alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with lower complexity.
